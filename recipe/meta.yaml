  summary: Compressor for genomic files (FASTQ, SAM/BAM/CRAM, VCF/BCF, FASTA, GVF, 23andMe), up to 5x better than gzip and faster too
  description: |
    Genozip
    
    (available on Conda, Docker Hub and https://github.com/divonlan/genozip ; Documentation: http://genozip.com)
    
    Genozip is a compressor for genomic files - while it can compress any file (i.e. not only genomic files), it is optimized to compress FASTQ, SAM/BAM/CRAM, VCF/BCF, FASTA, GVF, PHYLIP, Chain, Kraken and 23andMe files.

    Typically, a 2X-5X improvement over the existing compression is achieved when compressing already-compressed files like .fastq.gz .bam vcf.gz and much higher ratios in some other cases. 
     
    Yes, Genozip can compress already-compressed files (.gz .bz2 .xz .bam .cram). 
     
    The compression is lossless - the decompressed file is 100% identical to the original file (see documentation for exceptions).

    The command line options are similar to gzip and samtools/bcftools, so if you are familiar with these, it works pretty much the same. To get started, see: http://genozip.com
